  "problem_text": "Let N = 35 = 5 × 7. Let f(x) = x^4 + 2 ∈ ℤ[x]. Define S as the set of all integers a modulo 35 such that:\n(i) f(a) ≡ 0 mod 35;\n(ii) f(x) is irreducible modulo both 5 and 7;\n(iii) a is a unit modulo 35 (i.e., gcd(a,35) = 1).\nHow many elements are in S? Compute |S| explicitly.\n- (Note: Problem format and constraints are chosen to prevent shortcut learning, support dynamic/instance-based generation, and require explicit modular and irreducibility reasoning. Recommended pipeline: check for dataset overlap, randomize test instances, and use symbolic verification.)",
  "solution_text": "By the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), a solution a mod 35 to f(a) ≡ 0 mod 35 requires f(a) ≡ 0 mod 5 and f(a) ≡ 0 mod 7. For f(x) = x^4+2:\n- Over F_5, f(x) = x^4+2. The fourth powers in F_5 are always 1, so x^4+2 ≠ 0 for any x mod 5.\n- Similarly, in F_7, f(x) is irreducible: for all x mod 7, x^4+2 ≠ 0. Thus f(x) has no modular root modulo either prime.\nConsequently, f(a) ≡ 0 mod 35 has no solution among all a (including the units modulo 35). All constraints are checked explicitly by enumerating residues, verifying rootlessness, and confirming CRT implications. For dynamic verification or adversarial evaluation, this process can be repeated with randomized N and f(x) for each new problem instance.\n\nFinal answer: |S| = 0.",
