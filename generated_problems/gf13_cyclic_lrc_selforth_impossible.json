  "problem_text": "Work over GF(13). Let n = 12 and fix α = 2 ∈ GF(13) as a primitive 12th root of unity (so x^12 − 1 = ∏_{j=0}^{11} (x − α^j)). Let C be a cyclic code of length 12 with monic generator polynomial g(x) and parity-check polynomial h(x) = (x^12 − 1)/g(x).\n\nAssume: (i) h(x) is divisible by L(x) = 1 + x^4 + x^8; (ii) C is Euclidean self-orthogonal (C ⊆ C^⊥) over GF(13).\n\nQuestion. How many cyclic codes C (equivalently, monic divisors g(x) of x^12 − 1) satisfy (i) and (ii)? Give the exact integer N.",
  "solution_text": "Let Z ⊆ {0,…,11} be the defining set of C: g(x) = ∏_{j∈Z} (x − α^j). Since 12 | (13 − 1), all cyclotomic cosets are singletons.\n\n1) Locality divisibility L | h: the zeros of L are exactly indices S = {j : j ≡ 1,2 (mod 3)}. If L | h, then S ⊆ zeros(h), hence S ∩ Z = ∅ and thus Z ⊆ {0,3,6,9}.\n\n2) Euclidean self-orthogonality is equivalent to Z ⊇ Z_n \\ (−Z), i.e., Z ∪ (−Z) = Z_n; in particular 0 and 6 must lie in Z and for each pair {i, −i} at least one element must be in Z. But since Z ⊆ {0,3,6,9}, neither 1 nor 11 can lie in Z, so 1 ∉ Z ∪ (−Z), contradicting self-orthogonality.\n\nTherefore no such C exists, and the number of admissible codes is N = 0.",
