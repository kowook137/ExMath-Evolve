For 2^e with e ≥ 3, (Z/2^eZ)^× ≅ C2 × C_{2^{e−2}}.\n- For a finite abelian p-group ⊕_i C_{p^{λ_i}}, the image of the multiplication-by-k map on its p-primary part has invariants λ'_i = max(λ_i − v_p(k), 0) (valuation truncation).\n- Counting lemma: in ⊕_i C_{p^{λ'_i}}, the number of elements with order dividing p^a is p^{Σ_i min(a, λ'_i)}. The number with exact order p^a is the difference between a and a−1 levels.\n- Subtlety: The 2-adic congruence x ≡ 1 (mod 8) kills the C2 factor in (Z/2^eZ)^× and imposes an index-2 cut inside the large cyclic factor; here it aligns with the image of the even power map on the 2-adic component.\n\nAnswer format:\n- Provide a closed-form integer and a rigorous derivation using the above structural decomposition and exact-order counting. Avoid brute-force enumeration of residues.\n",
  "solution_text": "Solution:\n\nWe decompose G = (Z/NZ)^× via CRT into prime-power unit groups and then into Sylow q-subgroups for q ∈ {2,3,5,7}. We analyze the image H = Im Φ_k and intersect it with the 2-adic congruence constraint.\n\nStep 1: Component orders and 2-adic structure.\n- For odd primes, (Z/p^eZ)^× is cyclic of order φ(p^e) = p^{e−1}(p−1):\n  |(Z/3^5Z)^×| = 3^4·2 = 162, |(Z/5^4Z)^×| = 5^3·4 = 500, |(Z/7^3Z)^×| = 7^2·6 = 294.\n- For 2^9, (Z/2^9Z)^× ≅ C2 × C_{2^7}. The subgroup of elements ≡ 1 (mod 8) has order 2^{9−3} = 64 and is cyclic; it is the unique index-2 subgroup of the large cyclic factor.\n\nStep 2: Power-map truncation by valuations v_q(k).\nWrite k = 2·3^2·5, so (v_2, v_3, v_5, v_7)(k) = (1, 2, 1, 0). The effect on each Sylow q-subgroup is to subtract v_q(k) from its invariant exponents, clamped at 0.\n- q = 2:\n  • From 2^9: C2 × C_{2^7} → C_{2^6} under k (the C2 factor dies; 2^7 reduces by 1). This image equals the congruence subgroup {x ≡ 1 (mod 8)} of size 64, so the congruence imposes no further loss after Φ_k.\n  • From 3^5: the 2-part is C_2 (since 3−1 = 2); subtract v_2(k)=1 → trivial.\n  • From 5^4: the 2-part is C_{2^2} (since 5−1 = 4); subtract 1 → C_2.\n  • From 7^3: the 2-part is C_2 (since 7−1 = 6); subtract 1 → trivial.\n  Hence the global 2-primary part of H is C_{2^6} × C_2 with invariants [6,1].\n- q = 3:\n  • From 3^5: 3-primary is C_{3^4}; subtract v_3(k)=2 → C_{3^2}.\n  • From 7^3: 3-primary is C_3; subtract 2 → trivial. Others contribute none. So H_3 ≅ C_{3^2}.\n- q = 5:\n  • From 5^4: 5-primary is C_{5^3}; subtract v_5(k)=1 → C_{5^2}. Others contribute none. So H_5 ≅ C_{5^2}.\n- q = 7:\n  • From 7^3: 7-primary is C_{7^2}; v_7(k)=0 so unchanged. So H_7 ≅ C_{7^2}.\n\nStep 3: Exact-order counting in each Sylow and product assembly.\nLet T = 2^6·3^2·5^2·7^2. Orders across distinct primes multiply. We count exact p^a orders in each H_q and multiply the results.\n- q = 2: H_2 ≅ C_{2^6} ⊕ C_2 has invariants λ = [6,1]. The number with exact order 2^6 equals\n  2^{min(6,6)+min(6,1)} − 2^{min(5,6)+min(5,1)} = 2^{7} − 2^{6} = 64.\n- q = 3: H_3 ≅ C_{3^2} gives φ(3^2) = 3^2 − 3 = 6 elements of exact order 3^2.\n- q = 5: H_5 ≅ C_{5^2} gives φ(5^2) = 25 − 5 = 20 elements of exact order 5^2.\n- q = 7: H_7 ≅ C_{7^2} gives φ(7^2) = 49 − 7 = 42 elements of exact order 7^2.\nMultiplying, the number of x with ord(x) = T inside H is\n  64 · 6 · 20 · 42 = 322560.\n\nFinal Answer:\n322560\n\nVerification plan (machine-checkable):\n1) Factor k and verify valuations: check 90 = 2·3^2·5.\n2) Confirm group orders: φ(2^9)=256, φ(3^5)=3^4·2=162, φ(5^4)=5^3·4=500, φ(7^3)=7^2·6=294.\n3) 2-adic structure: verify (Z/2^9Z)^× has order 2^8 and splits as C2 × C_{2^7}; the subgroup ≡ 1 (mod 8) has size 2^{6}=64.\n4) Image size of Φ_k on the 2-adic large cyclic: gcd(2^7, 90) = 2, so image has size 2^7/2 = 64, matching the ≡ 1 (mod 8) subgroup.\n5) Post-truncation invariants by prime q:\n   - q=2: from components (2^9,5^4) get λ' = [6,1]; others trivial.\n   - q=3: from 3^5 get λ'=2; from 7^3 becomes trivial.\n   - q=5: from 5^4 get λ'=2.\n   - q=7: from 7^3 get λ'=2.\n6) Exact-order counts via the lemma:\n   - q=2: 2^{min(6,6)+min(6,1)} − 2^{min(5,6)+min(5,1)} = 128 − 64 = 64.\n   - q=3: 3^{min(2,2)} − 3^{min(1,2)} = 9 − 3 = 6.\n   - q=5: 5^{min(2,2)} − 5^{min(1,2)} = 25 − 5 = 20.\n   - q=7: 7^{min(2,2)} − 7^{min(1,2)} = 49 − 7 = 42.\n7) Multiply to get the final count: 64·6·20·42 = 322560.\n",
