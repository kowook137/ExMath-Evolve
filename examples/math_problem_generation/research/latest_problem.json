Document basis with pole orders explicitly.\n\n###### (c) Generator matrix\n- For \\(n = |S|\\), build 5\\(\\times\\)n matrix G: G_{ij} = f_i(P_j), with S ordered as in (a).\n\n###### (d) Minimal-norm embedding \\(\\varphi\\)\n- For each \\(a\\in\\mathbb{F}_{13}\\), explicitly (script or table) identify minimal-norm representative in \\(\\mathbb{Z}[i]/(13)\\) (|c|+|d| minimized, a\\equiv c+di mod 13), and confirm some entries are nontrivially imaginary or complex.

For non-basis codeword, compute and document explicit syndrome with H.\n\n###### (g) Automorphism group and Schur square\n- Use Magma/Sage to compute automorphism group order and full Schur square dimension; if values are close to RS/BCH/tRS, compute and document canonical form/dimension sequence.\n\n###### (h) Non-equivalence\n- Compare all invariants—including canonical forms in ambiguous scenarios—to literature. Document and script as per code equivalence methodology in recent literature (arXiv:1911.13059, mdpi.com).\n\n#### Final Answer\nThe minimum Mannheim distance d_M (integer value for this code).\n",
