Since 76 is not a perfect square, f(x) is irreducible over Q by the quadratic discriminant criterion. Higher degree: use Berlekamp–Zassenhaus, Newton polygon, or appropriate CAS code; log all steps and failures.\\n\\n**Bonus:** The order of a modulo N is lcm(10,9) = 90.\\n\\nTags: CRT, order-mod-pk, minimal-polynomial, irreducibility, algebraic-integer, agent-scoring, solution-tree",
