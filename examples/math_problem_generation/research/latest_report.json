The final answer is a single explicit integer (least n) with a deterministic verification plan relying on modular exponentiation and valuation checks rather than brute force. The solution deploys LTE (including the p=2 case), order-lifting modulo prime powers, the non-Wieferich status of 11 for base 2, and a CRT stitching of local conditions.

By LTE (odd p, a ≡ 1 mod p): v_3(10^n − 1) = v_3(10 − 1) + v_3(n) = v_3(9) + v_3(n) = 2 + v_3(n). The requirement v_3(10^n − 1) = 4 gives v_3(n) = 2, i.e., 9 | n and 27 ∤ n.\\n\\n(2) For p = 5 with a = 6, 5 | (6 − 1) and 5 ∤ 6. LTE yields v_5(6^n − 1) = v_5(6 − 1) + v_5(n) = 1 + v_5(n) = 3, so v_5(n) = 2, i.e., 25 | n and 125 ∤ n.\\n\\n(3) For p = 7 with a = 20 ≡ −1 (mod 7). If n were odd then 20^n ≡ −1 (mod 7) and 7 ∤ (20^n − 1), contradicting the required positive valuation. So n is even. By LTE for odd p with a ≡ −1 (mod p) and even n: v_7(20^n − 1) = v_7(20 + 1) + v_7(n) = v_7(21) + v_7(n) = 1 + v_7(n). The target v_7(20^n − 1) = 3 implies v_7(n) = 2, i.e., 49 | n and 343 ∤ n.\\n\\n(4) For p = 2 with a = 3 odd. If n were odd then v_2(3^n − 1) = v_2(3 − 1) = 1, which is incompatible with v_2 = 7. Hence n is even. The 2-adic LTE gives v_2(3^n − 1) = v_2(3 − 1) + v_2(3 + 1) + v_2(n) − 1 = 1 + 2 + v_2(n) − 1 = 2 + v_2(n). Setting 2 + v_2(n) = 7 yields v_2(n) = 5, i.e., 32 | n and 64 ∤ n. Equivalent group-theoretic check: ord_{2^7}(3) = 32 and ord_{2^8}(3) = 64; thus 3^n ≡ 1 (mod 2^7) iff 32 | n, while 3^n ≡ 1 (mod 2^8) iff 64 | n, matching v_2(n) = 5.\\n\\n(5) For p = 11 and base 2, ord_{11}(2) = 10. Moreover, 11 is not a Wieferich prime to base 2, since 2^{10} ≡ 56 ≠ 1 (mod 121), so by order-lifting (odd p) we have v_{11}(2^{10k} − 1) = 1 + v_{11}(k). Therefore, 11 | 2^n − 1 iff 10 | n, and 11^2 ∤ 2^n − 1 iff v_{11}(n/10) = 0, i.e., 11 ∤ (n/10). Our conditions thus impose 10 | n and 11 ∤ (n/10).

Condition (5) requires 10 | n (satisfied already) and 11 ∤ (n/10); taking t = 1 ensures 11 ∤ n and hence 11 ∤ (n/10). The least such n is attained at t = 1.\\n\\nThus the least positive integer satisfying all five conditions is\\nn = 2^5 · 3^2 · 5^2 · 7^2 = 32 · 9 · 25 · 49 = 352800.\\n\\nFinal answer: 352800.\",\n    \"final_answer\": 352800\n  },\n  \"verification_notes\": \"Deterministic plan to verify n = 352800.\\n1) Prime-power content of n:\\n   - Compute v2(352800) = 5, v3(352800) = 2, v5(352800) = 2, v7(352800) = 2, and confirm 11 ∤ 352800.\\n2) Condition (1): v3(10^n − 1) = 4.\\n   - Compute r4 = pow(10, n, 3**4) and check r4 == 1.\\n   - Compute r5 = pow(10, n, 3**5) and check r5 != 1.\\n   - This confirms 3^4 | (10^n − 1) but 3^5 ∤ (10^n − 1).\\n3) Condition (2): v5(6^n − 1) = 3.\\n   - Compute s3 = pow(6, n, 5**3) and check s3 == 1.\\n   - Compute s4 = pow(6, n, 5**4) and check s4 != 1.\\n4) Condition (3): v7(20^n − 1) = 3.\\n   - Compute t3 = pow(20, n, 7**3) and check t3 == 1.\\n   - Compute t4 = pow(20, n, 7**4) and check t4 != 1.\\n   - Also optionally confirm n is even.\\n5) Condition (4): v2(3^n − 1) = 7.\\n   - Compute u7 = pow(3, n, 2**7) and check u7 == 1.\\n   - Compute u8 = pow(3, n, 2**8) and check u8 != 1.\\n6) Condition (5): exact divisibility by 11.\\n   - Compute a1 = pow(2, n, 11) and check a1 == 1.\\n   - Compute a2 = pow(2, n, 121) and check a2 != 1.\\n7) Edge checks:\\n   - Ensure the minimality: any proper divisor n' of n fails at least one valuation condition due to reduced v_p(n') for p ∈ {2,3,5,7}.
