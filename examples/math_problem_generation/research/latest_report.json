  "markdown_report": "1) Objective and constraints\n- Field/length: Work over GF(13) with length n = 12. Fix the primitive element 2 ∈ GF(13)× (order 12) so the primitive 12th root of unity is α = 2, with α^j = 2^j for j = 0,…,11.\n- Locality (r = 2): Enforce that the parity-check polynomial h(x) is divisible by L(x) = 1 + x^4 + x^8. This prescribes 3-term cyclic locality checks supported on arithmetic progressions with step 4 modulo 12.\n- Dual/orthogonality: Require Euclidean self-orthogonality C ⊆ C^⊥. In defining-set language (gcd(n, q) = 1, singleton q-cyclotomic cosets), this is equivalent to Z(C) ⊇ Z_n \\ (−Z(C)), or equivalently Z(C) ∪ (−Z(C)) = Z_n; in particular the fixed points 0 and, because n is even, 6 must lie in Z(C).\n- Distance: A BCH-style designed-distance constraint may be invoked, but will be shown irrelevant given the two structural constraints above.\n- Uniqueness/verifiability: The task culminates in an exact integer count. We show the constraints are inconsistent and the exact number of admissible codes is N = 0.\n- Prohibited shortcuts: Do not place the locality factor into g(x); the locality factor must divide h(x) (dual side). Do not confuse Euclidean with Hermitian duality.\n\n2) Problem statement\nLet C be a cyclic code of length n = 12 over GF(13). Fix α = 2 ∈ GF(13) as a primitive 12th root of unity and represent exponents modulo 12. Let g(x) be the monic generator polynomial of C and h(x) = (x^12 − 1)/g(x) the monic parity-check polynomial.\n\nConstraints:\n(i) Locality: h(x) is divisible by L(x) = 1 + x^4 + x^8.\n(ii) Euclidean self-orthogonality: C ⊆ C^⊥ over GF(13).\n(iii) Designed-distance clause (BCH-type) may be used if needed but is not required to be explicitly stated in terms of consecutive exponents.\n\nQuestion. Determine the exact number N of cyclic codes C (equivalently, of monic generator polynomials g(x) | x^12 − 1) satisfying (i)–(ii). Give N as a single integer.\n\n3) Solution\nStep 0. Preliminaries.\n- Since 12 | (13 − 1), x^12 − 1 splits completely over GF(13) as ∏_{j=0}^{11} (x − α^j) with α = 2. Cyclotomic cosets modulo 12 under q = 13 are singletons, so defining sets Z ⊆ {0,…,11} correspond bijectively to cyclic codes via g(x) = ∏_{j∈Z} (x − α^j) and h(x) = ∏_{j∉Z} (x − α^j).\n- Euclidean dual defining-set rule (semisimple case): Z(C^⊥) = Z_n \\ (−Z(C)). Hence C ⊆ C^⊥ iff Z(C^⊥) ⊆ Z(C), i.e., Z ⊇ Z_n \\ (−Z). Equivalently, Z ∪ (−Z) = Z_n and thus the fixed points 0 and 6 (since 6 ≡ −6) must belong to Z.\n\nStep 1. Consequence of the locality divisibility L | h.\nFactor x^12 − 1 = (x^4 − 1)(x^8 + x^4 + 1), so L(x) = 1 + x^4 + x^8 has as zeros exactly those 12th roots whose exponents are j ≡ 1,2 (mod 3). If L | h, then every zero of L is a zero of h; equivalently, those exponents cannot be zeros of g. In defining-set language, this forces\nZ ⊆ {0,3,6,9}.\nIndeed, Z is disjoint from S := {1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11}, so Z ⊆ S^c = {0,3,6,9}.\n\nStep 2. Self-orthogonality contradicts the locality-imposed restriction.\nSelf-orthogonality requires Z ∪ (−Z) = Z_n. But if Z ⊆ {0,3,6,9}, then for the pair {1,11} neither 1 nor 11 can lie in Z, so 1 ∉ Z ∪ (−Z), violating Z ∪ (−Z) = Z_n. Therefore no defining set Z can simultaneously satisfy L | h and C ⊆ C^⊥.\n\nStep 3. Role of BCH clause.\nAny additional BCH-style distance requirement only further restricts admissible codes, so it cannot resolve the inconsistency. Therefore the feasible set is empty regardless of the designed-distance target.\n\nConclusion. The exact count of such codes is\nN = 0.\n\n4) Verification guidance\n- Exhaustive algebraic check:\n  1) Enumerate all subsets Z ⊆ {0,…,11}. Compute h implicitly via complements (zeros(h) = Z^c) or form g(x) = ∏_{j∈Z} (x − α^j) and h(x) = (x^12 − 1)/g(x).\n  2) Locality test: L | h is equivalent here to Z ∩ S = ∅ with S = {1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11} (since zeros(h) must contain the zeros of L). An equivalent computational test is h mod L = 0 in GF(13)[x].\n  3) Euclidean self-orthogonality test: verify Z ∪ (−Z) = Z_n (negation map i ↦ (12 − i) mod 12), and check that 0,6 ∈ Z.\n  4) No subset will satisfy both tests; the count must be 0.\n- Optional spectral cross-check: Compute the spectrum of L to confirm its zero set indices are S (j ≡ 1,2 mod 3). The condition L | h forces S ⊆ zeros(h), i.e., S ∩ Z = ∅; this immediately implies Z ⊆ {0,3,6,9} and contradicts self-orthogonality as above.\n- Edge checks: confirm α = 2 has order 12 in GF(13); verify factorization x^12 − 1 = (x^4 − 1)(x^8 + x^4 + 1); check that 0 and 6 are self-inverse indices and thus mandatory for self-orthogonality.\n\nFinal answer: N = 0.",

    "description": "Fuse a dual-side locality constraint L | h with Euclidean self-orthogonality via defining-set duality in the fully split regime n | (q−1). Over GF(13), n=12, L(x)=1+x^4+x^8 forces Z ⊆ {0,3,6,9}, while self-orthogonality requires Z ∪ (−Z) = Z_n (hence 0 and 6 in Z and every pair {i,−i} represented). These are incompatible, yielding a precise impossibility (count N=0).",

Euclidean self-orthogonality is tested by Z ∪ (−Z) = Z_n (so fixed points 0 and 6 must be in Z). Since Z ⊆ {0,3,6,9}, indices {1,11} violate the union condition, so no solution exists.
