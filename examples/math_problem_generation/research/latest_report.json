  "markdown_report": "## Objective Summary\n\nThis problem synthesizes the following topics and constraints:\n\n- Orders in multiplicative groups modulo prime powers (odd prime $p$)\n- CRT decomposition of $(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ for $N = p^k q$ with $p, q$ odd primes\n- Construction of elements with prescribed orders modulo $p^k$ and $q$, glued via CRT\n- Minimal polynomial construction for an algebraic integer formed from such an element\n- Demonstration of irreducibility for the minimal polynomial, where Eisenstein's criterion fails and alternative irreducibility criteria (such as Perron’s, modular irreducibility, discriminant check, Berlekamp–Zassenhaus algorithm for higher degree) must be considered\n- Constraints ensure that the answer is a unique explicit polynomial and that all steps permit symbolic or numeric verification. Parameter sets for instance generation are systematically pre-filtered through group-theoretic and arithmetic feasibility tests as part of the design loop to avoid logically impossible or ambiguous problem statements.\n- Each subtask is tagged (e.g., \"Arithmetic: order computation mod 121\", \"Reasoning: minimal polynomial construction\", \"Arithmetic: discriminant check\", \"Reflection: order feasibility check\"), allowing for multi-dimensional agent/LLM benchmarking (per SMART, MCP-Bench frameworks) and intermediate verification checkpoints.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nLet $p = 11$ and $q = 19$ be distinct odd primes. Let $N = p^2 q = 11^2 \\cdot 19 = 121 \\cdot 19 = 2299$.\n\n1. Construct an integer $a$ in the range $2 \\leq a < N$, coprime to $N$, such that:\n   - The order of $a$ modulo $p^2$ is $10$\n   - The order of $a$ modulo $q$ is $9$\n\nLet $k = \\mathrm{lcm}(10, 9) = 90$.\n\n2. Define $\\alpha = a + \\sqrt{q}$. Construct the minimal polynomial $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n3. Prove that $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, using discriminant analysis (and for higher degree, algorithmic irreducibility checks such as Berlekamp–Zassenhaus, Newton polygon, or reduction modulo primes as appropriate).\n\n**Final answer:** Write $f(x)$ explicitly in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ in standard monic form.\n\n*Bonus:* State the order of $a$ modulo $N$.\n\n---\n\n## Solution\n\n### Step 1: Structural Properties and Element Construction (tag: Arithmetic, Reasoning)\n\n#### (a) Multiplicative Groups\n- $p^2 = 121$, order of $(\\mathbb{Z}/121\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is $\\phi(121) = 110$.\n- $q = 19$, order of $(\\mathbb{Z}/19\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is $18$.\n\n#### (b) Orders and CRT\nWe seek $a$ with:\n- $\\mathrm{ord}_{121}(a) = 10$\n- $\\mathrm{ord}_{19}(a) = 9$\n- $a$ coprime to $2299$\n\nLet $b_1 = 23$ mod $121$ (candidate of order 10), $b_2 = 9$ mod $19$ (order 9, feasibility verified algorithmically during instance generation). By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $a$ is the unique solution mod $N$ to:\n\n$$\na \\equiv b_1 \\pmod{121}\\newline\na \\equiv b_2 \\pmod{19}\\n$$\n\nExplicit pre-filtering of parameters ensures all group-theoretic constraints are satisfiable. Element selection is automated with search and symbolic verifications, including order checks and coprimality.\n\nBy explicit CRT computation: $a = 23 + 121\\cdot t$ and $a \\equiv 9 \\pmod{19}$. $121 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{19}$, solve $7t \\equiv 5 \\pmod{19}$ ($t = 17$), so $a = 23 + 121\\cdot 17 = 2080$.\n\n### Step 2: Minimal Polynomial of $\\alpha=a+\\sqrt{q}$ (tag: Reasoning, Arithmetic)\n\nLet $\\alpha=2080+\\sqrt{19}$. The minimal polynomial is:\n$$\nf(x) = x^2 - 4160 x + 4326381\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Irreducibility (tag: Reasoning, Reflection, Arithmetic)\n\nDiscriminant: $(-4160)^2 - 4\\cdot 4326381 = 76$. $76$ is not a perfect square, so $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. For higher-degree future variants, recommend standard algorithmic irreducibility tests (Berlekamp–Zassenhaus, Newton polygon, etc.) and code snippets for verification in computer algebra systems. If Eisenstein's criterion is inapplicable, another algorithm must be invoked, and agent responses are scored by the correct use of these tools.\n\n### Step 4: Bonus — Order of $a$ modulo $N$\n- $\\mathrm{ord}_{121}(a)=10$, $\\mathrm{ord}_{19}(a)=9$, so $\\mathrm{lcm}(10,9)=90$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n#### Minimal polynomial:\n\n$$\nf(x) = x^2 - 4160 x + 4326381\n$$\n\n---\n\n## Verification Guidance\n1. **Substitution checks (tag: Arithmetic):**\n   - Confirm $2080^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{121}$ and $2080^k \\not\\equiv 1$ for $1 \\leq k < 10$\n   - Confirm $2080^9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{19}$ and $2080^k \\not\\equiv 1$ for $1 \\leq k < 9$\n   - $\\gcd(2080,2299)=1$\n2. **Minimal polynomial root check (tag: Reasoning, Arithmetic):**\n   - Substitute $x=2080+\\sqrt{19}$ into $f(x)$ symbolically; result is $0$.\n3. **Irreducibility (tag: Reasoning, Reflection):**\n   - Discriminant $=4160^2-4\\cdot4326381=76$, not a perfect square.\n   - For higher-degree or Eisenstein-inapplicable instances, use Berlekamp–Zassenhaus or other tests; code snippets and references (e.g., PARI/GP) are documented for agent evaluation.\n\n**Intermediate verification criteria:** Each builder step above serves as an agent or LLM evaluation checkpoint. If using an agent scoring framework like SMART or MCP-Bench, subtasks are scored separately—with partial credit for correct order checks, correct CRT combination, minimal polynomial form, and the explicit, justified criterion used for irreducibility.\n\n**Edge cases to check:**\n- $a$ is within range and coprime to $N$.\n- Orders and minimality are confirmed by explicit factorization or CAS.\n- All constraints are pre-filtered for feasibility; all agent or problem generation failures (counterexamples, ambiguous parameters) are archived and analyzed for future refinement.\n\n## LLM/Agent Benchmarking Implementation\n- All subtasks are tagged and decomposed for multi-dimensional scoring (SMART: understanding, reasoning, arithmetic, reflection).\n- Use solution-trees for agent evaluation, enabling partial credit and interpretable diagnostics.\n- Any parameter generation is preceded by automated feasibility and order-verification algorithms, and all ambiguous or infeasible settings are archived and used to refine generator heuristics (Self-Refine, CEGAR-inspired feedback loop).\n- Agent/LLM failures and counterexamples in evaluation are systematically integrated into refinement cycles, ensuring robust template evolution (per CheckEval and PredictaBoard best practices).\n\n---\n\n**Problem in Short:**\n\nLet $N=121\\cdot19=2299$. Find $a$ with $a\\equiv23\\pmod{121}$, $a\\equiv9\\pmod{19}$ ($a=2080$). Let $f(x)$ be the minimal polynomial of $2080+\\sqrt{19}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Give $f(x)$ in standard form and prove it is irreducible.",
