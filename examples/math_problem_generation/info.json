    "description": "Generate novel mathematics problems paired with verified solutions that remain difficult for large language models. Each iteration should produce a problem specification, synthesize a fully-written question and solution, verify correctness symbolically or numerically, and run an automated LLM solver to estimate difficulty. Problems that pass verification yet defeat the evaluator model should be archived.",

    "title": "Automated creation of LLM-resistant math problems",
    "content": "Start from curated graduate-level topics (algebra, number theory, combinatorics) and assemble new problems by combining known theorems with uncommon twists. After drafting a problem and solution, run SymPy-based validation to ensure the answer satisfies all constraints. Finally, query a baseline LLM with a strict prompt; if it fails or produces a low-quality explanation, mark the problem as sufficiently difficult.",
