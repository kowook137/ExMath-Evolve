A linear map from a finite vector space to F2 is either the zero map or surjective. If pi is identically 0, then every codeword has even weight. Otherwise ker(pi) has codimension 1, so exactly half the codewords map to 0 (even weight) and the other half map to 1 (odd weight).",

Using wt(u+v) = wt(u) + wt(v) - 2t and u.v = t (mod 2) = 0 for u, v in C, one checks that phi is linear. Hence phi is either the zero map (so wt(c) is 0 mod 4 for all c), or surjective (ker(phi) has index 2, giving exactly half with wt(c) = 0 mod 4 and half with wt(c) = 2 mod 4).",
