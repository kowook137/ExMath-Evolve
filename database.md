# FrontierMath Benchmark Problems and Solutions

This document pairs the publicly available problems from the FrontierMath benchmark with brief summaries of their solutions. Each problem demands significant mathematical insight, yet the key idea and final answer can often be summarised succinctly. Where appropriate, references are provided to the official FrontierMath site.

## 1. An optimization problem in BMO space (Tier 4)

**Problem.** Find $c + 1985/2$ where
$$c = \sup_f \int_0^1 (f(t)^3 + |f(t)|) \, dt$$
over all integrable functions $f: [0, 1] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $\int_0^1 f(t) \, dt = -10$, $\int_0^1 f(t)^2 \, dt = 100 + 1/12$ and bounded mean–oscillation norm
$$\sup_{J \subset [0, 1]} \frac{1}{|J|} \int_J \left| f(t) - |J|^{-1} \int_J f(s) \, ds \right|^2 dt \le \frac{1}{12}.$$

**Solution idea.** The problem can be reinterpreted as a Bellman‑function optimization: letting $B(x_1, x_2; \varepsilon)$ denote the supremum of $\int_0^1 F(f(t)) dt$ under constraints $\int f = x_1$, $\int f^2 = x_2$ and BMO bound $\varepsilon$, one notes $c = B(-10, 100 + 1/12; 1/12)$ and solves a corresponding Monge–Ampère equation. The boundary conditions force a solution of the form $B(x_1, x_2) = F(x_1)$ on the parabola $x_2 = x_1^2$ and require delicate “trolleybus” geometry; the extremizer turns out to be a piecewise constant function. Inserting $x_1 = -10$ and $x_2 = 100 + 1/12$ yields $c$ (the provided text for the value of c is garbled), so the desired value is $\left(\frac{1985}{2}+c\right)$.

## 2. Elliptic curves and higher Galois theory (Tier 4)

**Problem.** Define the $q$‑series
$$F(z)=1+\sum_{n\geq 1}\frac{e^{2\pi i n^2 z}}{\prod_{j=1}^n(1+e^{2\pi i jz})^2},\qquad G(z)=\prod_{n\geq 1}\frac{(1-e^{2\pi i n z})(1-e^{2\pi i(2n-1)z})}{1+e^{2\pi i n z}},$$
and let $\ell_1$ be the smallest prime for which
1. $D_{\ell_1}=-\ell_1$ is the discriminant of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-\ell_1})$,
2. its class number $h(D_{\ell_1})$ is a prime $\ell_2 \geq 5$,
3. the residue class $\ell_2 \bmod \ell_1$ is a primitive root in $(\mathbb{Z}/\ell_1\mathbb{Z})^\times$, and
4. the Mordell–Weil group of the elliptic curve $Y^2=X^3-\ell_1^2X$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.

For this pair of primes define
$$\alpha=\lim_{y\to 0^+}\left(F\Bigl(\frac{\ell_1}{4\ell_2}+iy\Bigr)-G\Bigl(\frac{\ell_1}{4\ell_2}+iy\Bigr)+\frac{F}{G}-\frac{G}{F}\right),$$
let $P_{\alpha}(X)$ be its minimal polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$ and let $K_{\alpha}$ be the splitting field. Compute
$$\Omega=\frac{1}{[K_{\alpha}:\mathbb{Q}]}\bigl(P_{\alpha}(\ell_1)+P_{\alpha}(\ell_2)\bigr)^{\ell_2-1}.$$

**Solution idea.** Conditions (1)–(3) allow a finite search for pairs $(\ell_1, \ell_2)$ with $\ell_1 \equiv 3 \pmod 8$. The only viable pair with $\ell_1 < 240$ is $\ell_1 = 227, \ell_2 = 5$. Ramanujan’s mock theta function $f(q)$ and a modular correction $b(q)$ show that $\alpha = -4\zeta^6 + 4\zeta^5 - 4\zeta^2 + 12$ with $\zeta = e^{2\pi i \cdot 227/20}$. The minimal polynomial $P_{\alpha}(X)$ has degree 8 and can be computed via explicit cyclotomic field calculations; one finds $P_{\alpha}(227)=4931792858591731505$ and $P_{\alpha}(5)=6546641$. Since $K_{\alpha}=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$ has degree 8, the formula above yields
$$\Omega = \frac{1}{8} (P_{\alpha}(227) + P_{\alpha}(5))^4 = 73948492097301691765464030714938921180352979774791349212169829996615700482.$$

## 3. Combinatorics in the Tsirelson space (Tier 3)

**Problem.** Within Tsirelson’s Banach space $T$ (defined by the closed unit ball generated by $\vec e_j$ and the rule that half of any block vector is again in the unit ball), let $N$ be the largest natural number such that there exists $\vec x \in T$ with $x_3 = \frac{1}{2}$, $x_N > \frac{1}{20}$, and $x_i > x_j$ for all $3 \le i < j \le N$. Writing $N = m2^p$ with $m$ odd, find $p$.

**Solution idea.** One constructs specific block sequences that realise rapidly growing support. An explicit family of sequences $\langle a, b, (m, n] \rangle$ is used to build elements of $T$ with prescribed support growth. By nesting blocks, one finds an element with last non‑zero coordinate at $f^3(3)$ where $f(n) = n2^n$; the exponent of 2 in $f^3(3)$ is $402653211$. A density argument shows that no smaller exponent is possible, so the required power of two dividing $N$ is $2^{402,653,211}$.

## 4. Enumerative geometry over finite fields (Tier 3)

**Problem.** Let $U$ be the space of smooth conics in $\mathbb{P}^2$ over $\mathbb{Z}$ and $Z \subset U^6$ the subscheme parametrising sextuples $(C_1, \dots, C_6)$ with $C_1$ tangent to $C_2, \dots, C_6$. For the finite étale morphism $\pi: Z \to U^5$, write $V \subset U^5$ for the locus where $\pi$ is finite étale and define
$$L = \lim_{p\to\infty} \frac{1}{\#V(\mathbb{F}_p)} \sum_{x \in V(\mathbb{F}_p)} \#\pi^{-1}(x).$$
Compute $\lfloor 100L\rfloor$.

**Solution idea.** Harris showed that $\pi$ has degree 3264 and full Galois group $S_{3264}$, which remains true over large finite fields. For $x \in V(\mathbb{F}_p)$, the number $\#\pi^{-1}(x)$ equals the number of cycles of the Frobenius element in $S_{3264}$. By Chebotarev’s density theorem and the fact that conjugacy classes are equidistributed, the average number of cycles in $S_m$ is the $m$‑th harmonic number $H_m$. Thus
$$L = \sum_{m=1}^{3264} \frac{1}{m} \approx 8.668,$$
so $\lfloor 100L\rfloor = 866$.

## 5. Testing Artin’s primitive root conjecture (Tier 3)

**Problem.** For a prime $p$ and integer $a \not\equiv 0 \pmod p$, let $\mathrm{ord}_p(a)$ be the multiplicative order of $a$ modulo $p$. Define
$$\mathrm{ord}_{p,x}(a) = \prod_{q\le x,\text{prime}} q^{v_q(\mathrm{ord}_p(a))} \prod_{q>x,\text{prime}} q^{v_q(p-1)},$$
and let $S_x$ be the set of primes $p$ for which $\mathrm{ord}_{p,x}(2) > \mathrm{ord}_{p,x}(3)$. Write $d_x$ for the density of $S_x$ in the primes up to $x$ and set $d_{\infty} = \lim_{x\to\infty} d_x$. Compute $\lfloor 10^6 d_{\infty}\rfloor$.

**Solution idea.** One is effectively asking for the proportion of primes $p$ for which $\mathrm{ord}_p(2) > \mathrm{ord}_p(3)$, with a technical truncation parameter to control error terms. Hooley’s proof of Artin’s primitive root conjecture (under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis) uses Chebotarev density and inclusion–exclusion to express the density of primes with prescribed orders in terms of products over primes. By carefully computing these densities and controlling tail errors, one obtains a seven‑digit approximation of $d_{\infty}$; the final result is $\lfloor 10^6 d_{\infty} \rfloor = 367,707$.

## 6. A recursive construction on large permutations (Tier 2)

**Problem.** Let $W$ be the set of finite words with distinct letters over the positive integers, and define $F: W \to W$ recursively by $F(\epsilon) = \epsilon$ and, for a non‑empty word $w$, writing $w = L m R$ with $m$ the largest letter, set $F(w) = F(L)F(R)m$. For $n = 10^{12}$ this restricts to a map $F: S_n \to S_n$ on the symmetric group. Choose a random permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ and let $X$ be the expected number of indices $1 \le i < n$ for which $(F(\sigma))^{-1}(i+1) < (F(\sigma))^{-1}(i)$. Compute $\lfloor X\rfloor$.

**Solution idea.** For a word $w$ and letters $a < b$, one shows that $b$ precedes $a$ in $F(w)$ if and only if there is a letter $c > b$ with $b \prec_w c \prec_w a$. Setting $A_i$ to be the event that there exists some $c > i+1$ with $i+1 \prec_\sigma c \prec_\sigma i$, linearity of expectation implies
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\mathbb{P}(A_i) = \frac{n+1}{2} - H_n,$$
where $H_n$ is the $n$‑th harmonic number. Substituting $n = 10^{12}$ yields $X \approx 5 \times 10^{11} - \tfrac{1}{2}$, so $\lfloor X\rfloor = 499,999,999,972$.

## 7. Asymptotics of solutions of a 5‑variable equation (Tier 2)

**Problem.** Find constants $C, \alpha, \beta$ such that the number of solutions to $ab+1 = cde$ with $a, b, c, d, e \in \mathbb{N}$ and $ab \le x$ is asymptotic to $C x^{\alpha}\log^{\beta} x$ as $x\to\infty$; compute $\lfloor 1000 C\rfloor$.

**Solution idea.** The number of solutions equals $\sum_{n \le x} d_2(n) d_3(n+1)$, where $d_k(n)$ denotes the $k$‑fold divisor function. Deep results (listed as a conjecture in the cited literature) show
$$\sum_{n\le x} d_2(n) d_3(n+1) \sim \frac{C_{2,3}}{2} x \log^3 x,$$
with $C_{2,3} = \prod_p \bigl( (1-1/p) + (1-1/p)^2 - (1-1/p)^3 \bigr) \approx 0.4284$. Hence $\alpha=1$, $\beta=3$ and $C \approx 0.2142$, so $\lfloor 1000C\rfloor = 214$.

## 8. Find the degree 19 polynomial (Tier 2)

**Problem.** Construct an odd, monic polynomial $p(x) \in \mathbb{C}[x]$ of degree 19 with real coefficients and linear term $-19x$ such that the curve $X = \{(x,y) : p(x) = p(y)\} \subset \mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$ has at least three (not all linear) irreducible components. Compute $p(19)$.

**Solution idea.** Using Riemann’s existence theorem and monodromy, any such $p$ defines a degree‑19 branched cover $\mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^1$ whose fibre product with itself splits into components according to the action of the monodromy group $G_p \subset S_{19}$. A theorem of Burnside implies $G_p$ must contain a normal 19‑cycle and two additional permutations each consisting of nine disjoint transpositions. The only polynomial with this monodromy structure is (up to affine transformation) the Chebyshev polynomial $T_{19}(x)$; imposing oddness and monicity forces $p(x) = 2 T_{19}(x/2)$. Evaluating at $x=19$ gives $p(19) = 187,657,207,197,409,480,339,117,9$.

## 9. Prime field continuous extensions (Tier 2)

**Problem.** Let $(a_n)$ be the integer sequence defined by the recurrence
$$a_n = 198130309625 \, a_{n-1} + 354973292077 \, a_{n-2} - 427761277677 \, a_{n-3} + 370639957 \, a_{n-4},$$
with $a_i=i$ for $0 \le i \le 3$. Find the smallest prime $p \equiv 4 \pmod 7$ for which $n \mapsto a_n$ extends to a continuous function on the $p$‑adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_p$.

**Solution idea.** The characteristic polynomial has degree 4. Skolem–Mahler–Lech theory shows that $a_n$ extends $p$‑adically if all roots $\alpha_i$ of the characteristic polynomial satisfy $v_L(\alpha_i - 1) > 0$ in a $p$‑adic field $L$. This forces $p$ to divide $370639957 + 1 = 370639958$ and $198130309625 - 4$; among the prime factors of these numbers, only $9811$ is congruent to $4 \bmod 7$. Checking modulo 9811 shows all roots reduce to $(x-1)^4$, so $n \mapsto a_n$ extends continuously to $\mathbb{Z}_{9811}$. Therefore the answer is $p = 9811$.

## 10. Counting nonzero solutions of homogeneous equations (Tier 1)

**Problem.** How many non‑zero projective points over $\mathbb{F}_{5^{18}}$ satisfy the homogeneous cubic equation $x^3y + y^3z + z^3x = 0$?

**Solution idea.** By evaluating the number of solutions over $\mathbb{F}_5$, $\mathbb{F}_{25}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{125}$ one sees that the smooth projective curve defined by $x^3y + y^3z = 0$ has genus 3 and $6, 26, 126$ points over these fields. Applying the Weil conjectures, one expresses the zeta function of the curve in terms of eigenvalues $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_6$ of Frobenius with $|\alpha_i| = \sqrt{5}$. Matching the first few point counts determines these eigenvalues (they are $\sqrt{5}$ times 12‑th roots of unity), and a formula for $|C(\mathbb{F}_{5^n})|$ then yields $|C(\mathbb{F}_{5^{18}})| = 5^{18} + 6 \cdot 5^9 + 1$, so the number of non‑zero projective solutions is $5^{18} + 6 \cdot 5^9$ (subtracting the point at infinity) which equals $3,814,708,984,376$.

## 11. Expected perimeter enclosing the center of a 101‑gon (Tier 1)

**Problem.** Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a regular 101‑gon of circumradius 1. Each diagonal of $\mathcal{P}$ is independently drawn with probability 0.001. The diagonals partition the polygon into regions; let $E$ be the expected perimeter of the region containing the centre. Compute $\lfloor 10^9 E\rfloor$.

**Solution idea.** Fix a diagonal $AB$ spanning $d$ edges. Other diagonals are classified as blockers (lying strictly between $AB$ and the centre), left‑crossers (intersecting $AB$ and separating $A$ from the centre) or right‑crossers (intersecting $AB$ and separating $B$ from the centre). Sorting the crossing points on $AB$ shows that a segment on $AB$ contributes to the perimeter of the region containing the centre exactly when no blockers are drawn and there are no later left‑ or right‑crossers. Summing contributions over all diagonals using trigonometric formulas for segment lengths and linearity of expectation yields an expected perimeter $E \approx 4.771880153 \times 10^{-1}$, so $\lfloor 10^9 E\rfloor = 4,771,880,153$.

## 12. Orbit counting of matrix tuples (Tier 1)

**Problem.** Let $S \subset M_{1000}^4$ be the set of quadruples $(A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4)$ of invertible $1000 \times 1000$ complex matrices satisfying $A_i^2 = I$ for all $i$, and for each pair $(i,j)$ either $A_i$ commutes with $A_j$ or $A_iA_jA_i^{-1}A_j^{-1} = A_jA_i$ according as $\{3j-i, 3i-j\}$ meets $5\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$. The group $G = GL(1000)$ acts on $S$ by simultaneous conjugation; find the number of orbits $|S/G|$.

**Solution idea.** The relations among the $A_i$ are precisely those of the Coxeter group $S_5$: the “braid” relation occurs only for pairs $(1,2), (2,4), (4,3)$. Thus specifying $(A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4)$ is equivalent to choosing a $1000$‑dimensional complex representation of $S_5$. The orbit under $GL(1000)$ depends only on the isomorphism class of the representation, so the number of orbits is the number of ways to write $1000$ as a direct sum of irreducible $S_5$‑modules. From the character table of $S_5$, the irreducible dimensions are $1, 1, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6$. Counting all possible multiplicity combinations corresponds to the coefficient of $t^{1000}$ in
$$\frac{1}{(1-t)^2(1-t^4)^2(1-t^5)^2(1-t^6)},$$
which equals $625,243,878,951$.
